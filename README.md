# Attendance Generation Using Face Recognition

This project automates student attendance using face recognition technology. It captures student images, trains a face recognition model, and marks attendance automatically when faces are detected through a webcam.

## Features

✅ Register students by capturing their face images  
✅ Train a face recognition model with OpenCV  
✅ Real-time face detection and recognition  
✅ Auto-generate attendance logs  
✅ Simple and easy-to-use interface

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tkinter (optional GUI)
- Pandas (for attendance CSV)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://https://github.com/Samruddhiiii/Smart-Attendance.git
   
Install required dependencies:
   ex: pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
Train the recognition model:
   python train_model.py
Run the attendance system:
  python main.py
Attendance will be saved in Attendance.csv.
